</div>

A loader for various TYPO3-related configuration, including system configuration and
configuration for third-party extensions. Based on the [`helhum/config-loader`][1]
library.

## üöÄ Features

* Config loader for [system configuration](src/Loader/System.php)
* Config loader for [EXT:solr](src/Loader/Solr.php)
* Compatible with TYPO3 12.4 LTS and 13.4 LTS

## üî• Installation

```bash
composer require cpsit/typo3-config-loader
```

## ‚ö° Usage

> [!TIP]
> Read more about loader-specific configuration in the appropriate class documentation.

### Basic (non-cached)

Add the following code snippet to your project's `config/system/additional.php` file:

```php
$systemConfiguration = new CPSIT\Typo3ConfigLoader\Loader\System();
$systemConfiguration->load();
```

In case your project uses EXT:solr, you can load its configuration as well:

```php
$solrConfiguration = new CPSIT\Typo3ConfigLoader\Loader\Solr();
$solrConfiguration->load();
```

### Cached

You can also use a cached version of the appropriate loaders:

```php
$systemConfiguration = new CPSIT\Typo3ConfigLoader\Loader\System();
$systemConfiguration->loadCached();
```

## üîç Readers

### Environment variables reader

The `Helhum\ConfigLoader\Reader\EnvironmentReader` is used within the `System` loader
to map environment variables to configuration values. Environment variables must be
prefixed by `TYPO3` and each configuration key must be separated by `__` (two underscore
characters).

**Example:**

* Environment variable: `TYPO3__MAIL__transport_smtp_server`
* Configuration path: `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['transport_smtp_server']`

## üí° Custom loaders

In case this library does not fulfill all your requirements, you are free to extend
it by your needs. A [`ConfigurationLoader`](src/Loader/ConfigurationLoader.php)
interface exists which can be used to provide additional loaders. Additionally, you
are free to make use of the [`EnvironmentCreator`](src/EnvironmentCreator.php) trait
which allows the transformation of loaded configuration to environment variables.

Next to the `ConfigurationLoader` there exists an extended interface that is able to
cache and load cached data. Use
[`CacheableConfigurationLoader`](src/Loader/CacheableConfigurationLoader.php) and
implement the additional method `loadCached` to make use of cached configuration.

Consider contributing to this project if you feel like some functionality is missing
or not yet fully covered.
